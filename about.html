                <p>Online voting systems are software platforms used to securely conduct votes and elections. As a digital platform, they eliminate the need to cast your votes using paper or having to gather in person.
 
                    They also protect the integrity of your vote by preventing voters from being able to vote multiple times.
                     
                    Many secure voting platform vendors provide supportive vote management consulting services that help organizations design and implement their voting procedures.
                     
                    These services help organizations save time, stick to best practices, and meet internal requirements and/or external regulations, such as third-party vote administration needs.</p>

                <br><br>
                <p> The short answer is: anyone who makes decisions.

                    Consistent, structured decision-making needs span across organization types and industries.
                    
                    Individuals in organizations ranging from award shows, to law firms, to corporations, to schools will find value in online voting.
                    
                    Simply put - if a group of people needs to make a decision, and that decision requires input from others, an online voting system will be of value. </p>
